- Take care to keep any imported parts (including metal extrusion stock like 80-20) in the appropriate COTS subfolder
if it doesn't exist in COTS, create a new subfolder.

-Ask questions/tips for construction, and regularly post progress screenshots (at least one per day) and push often.
make sure to keep changed files in a backup zipped folder when doing pulls due to possibility of commit conflicts.

- Happy CADsgiving!
