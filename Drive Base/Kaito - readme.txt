- Take care to keep any imported parts (including metal extrusion stock like 80-20) in the appropriate COTS subfolder
if it doesn't exist in COTS, create a new subfolder.

-Ensure that bumper construction is as close to the real thing as possible, refer to the Summer CAD or previous years'
bumper CAD for reference. Summer CAD should have a realistic foam density associated with it as well for analytics.

-It is not necessary to include team numbers on the sides of the bumpers but is strongly recommended, I suggest
creating a negligibly thin white layer in approximately size 14 Arial or Impact font.

-Ask questions/tips for construction, and regularly post progress screenshots (at least one per day) and push often.
make sure to keep changed files in a backup zipped folder when doing pulls due to possibility of commit conflicts.

- Happy CADsgiving!
